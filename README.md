This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Summary

Hello Dan! I completed the page following the mockup and using a good amount of components. In some cases, such as the building of the hero, I made the button in the hero component for brevity's sake. As the app grows I would put the button as its own component for reusability. 

- I made the secondary page the "videos" page, meaning every video has its own page pulling the description with it and showcased on its own page. The links on the videos work directly on the home page as well. 

- I made the "do something awesome" button pick a random video from the Staff's picks.

- Clicking on the avatar, leads to a drop down menu where we could have user sign out of account and edit his/her account.

- Responsive layout and burger menu appears for navbar, felt like adding some more options to showcase a burger menu when in mobile mode. 

-I did add animation to the logos and buttons as well.
